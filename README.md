# VReality

This is a product landing page for VR tools. I created this project to understand React.js betterâ€”how it works and how to use it efficiently.

## What I Learned from This Project
- Dividing the project into components for better code readability
- Using the `useState` hook to manage and update the state of actions
- Implementing conditional statements in JSX to return specific HTML elements
- Setting up the project with Vite, including Tailwind CSS and a live server for efficient development

## Technologies Used
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (frontend tool)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
